I have been researcher at the interface(s) between biology, chemistry and physics studying proteins, DNA and their interactions for 40 years, a teacher of molecular biology and biochemistry for 28 years, a husband for 34 years, a father for 35 and a widower and a grandfather for 4 years. I'm retiring from academics (at least for a while) to travel by bike and on foot for a year or so.
